                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>Welcome to the world of Laline, a world we created in 1999 and, like the real thing, continues to evolve, renew and grow ever since. From a small and charming store in the center of Tel Aviv, we have become the leading chain in Israel for body and soul care and lifestyle products, with over 180 stores in Israel and around the world.

                    But for us, this is all the resemblance to the "real" world.

                    In the white world we created, a world of pampering and relaxation, we invite you to leave the routine and the necessary behind and surrender to a romantic experience of pure pleasure, full of joy of life and inspiration. We encourage the Laline woman, the one whose Body and Soul are connected, to nurture herself with the fragrances and presence that express her personal and feminine statement.

                    For herself, her family, the man she loves or her best friends, our product collection offers a selection of body care products, bath and shower, scrubs and perfumes; Makeup, nail polish, facial care and beauty products; aromatic home atmosphere treats as well as lifestyle products to complete the experience.

                    The chain's leading product series are based on our favorite and exciting fragrances. Each of them has a rich variety of products that, when combined, provide the body and soul with a perfect care experience - from bathing to perfume. Alongside these, we have also developed dedicated series that provide attention and love to the entire family - women, men, babies and girls, and of course an exciting variety of gift boxes.

                    We embed the Lalin values ​​that have accompanied us throughout the years in every item and detail of our work: from innovation in product development to strict adherence to the quality of the ingredients, from precision in packaging design to the magical romance of the stores. All of this is done with the joy of creation that turns the encounter between body and soul into a celebration of pleasure and aesthetics.

                    And if we return for a moment to the real world, it is also important for us to have an impact and do something there, which is why Laline
                    takes social responsibility and is involved in supporting and promoting associations that work for the benefit of children, youth and women.

                    Don't strive for perfection, strive to be whole. Small pleasures create great moments. Happiness is not the goal, it is the means. The body is the temple of the soul. Enrich it.

                    Your own happiness - you alone.

                    The path to self-encouragement begins with encouraging others. The greatest pleasures are those you choose.

                    Celebrate,

                    Roytal Levy and Meirav Cohen
